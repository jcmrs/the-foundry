# "The Foundry" Project Roadmap & Specifications

#### **Mission Statement:**
To evolve "The Foundry" from a basic scaffolding framework into a sophisticated, AI-led development environment capable of managing the entire software lifecycle with increasing autonomy.

---

## **Phase 1: Foundational Intelligence (Completed)**

*   **Goal:** To establish a self-aware, version-controlled framework.
*   **Status:** **DONE**
*   **Key Milestones Achieved:**
    *   `[DONE]` Environment Bootstrap (`bootstrap-project.ps1`)
    *   `[DONE]` Project Manifest (`foundry.jsonc`)
    *   `[DONE]` Module Scaffolding Skill
    *   `[DONE]` Configuration Manager Module (`config-manager`)
    *   `[DONE]` Foundational Version Control (Git & GitHub)
    *   `[DONE]` Analysis Engine Module (`analysis-engine`)

---

## **Phase 2: The Command-Line Interface (CLI) - The "Forge"**

*   **Goal:** To expose the AI's learned skills and the framework's capabilities through an interactive command-line interface. This will be the primary tool for the AI to manage and interact with its projects. We will call this tool the "Forge."
*   **Status:** **PENDING**
*   **Core Specifications:**
    1.  **Command Parser Module:** The AI will build a new module, `command-parser`, responsible for parsing user/AI commands (e.g., `foundry analyze project`, `foundry create module <name>`).
    2.  **Forge CLI Entrypoint:** The AI will create a primary executable script (`forge.ts`) in the project root. This script will be the entry point for the CLI. It will use the `command-parser` to understand what to do.
    3.  **Integration of Existing Skills:** The AI will integrate its existing capabilities as the first commands of the Forge:
        *   A `project analyze` command that uses the `analysis-engine` to display the project structure.
        *   A `module create <name>` command that uses the "Module Scaffolding" skill.
    4.  **Help System:** The CLI must have a basic `help` command that lists available commands and their usage.

## **Phase 3: The Interactive Development Environment (IDE) & Task Execution**

*   **Goal:** To enable the AI to perform complex, multi-step development tasks autonomously by breaking them down and executing them through its own Forge CLI.
*   **Status:** **PENDING**
*   **Core Specifications:**
    1.  **Task Runner Module:** The AI will build a `task-runner` module that can execute a sequence of Forge commands from a definition file.
    2.  **Goal-to-Plan Capability:** The AI will be trained (via prompting) on the skill of taking a high-level goal (e.g., "add a new feature to validate user input") and decomposing it into a JSON or YAML "plan file" that lists the exact Forge commands to be executed (`module create validation`, `file create ...`, `test execute ...`, etc.).
    3.  **Autonomous Execution:** The AI will gain a `project execute-plan <plan-file>` command that uses the `task-runner` to execute the plan, effectively performing the entire `Isolate -> Modify -> Verify -> Integrate` loop autonomously.

---

## **Phase 4: Self-Improvement & Extensibility**

*   **Goal:** To enable the AI to add new commands to its own Forge CLI, effectively learning and expanding its own capabilities over time.
*   **Status:** **PENDING**
*   **Core Specifications:**
    1.  **Command Registration System:** The AI will refactor the Forge to have a formal command registration system, where new commands can be added by creating new files in a specific directory.
    2.  **`forge learn-command` Skill:** The ultimate goal. The AI will gain the ability to create a new command file, implement its logic, and register it with the Forge, making the new command instantly available for future use.
